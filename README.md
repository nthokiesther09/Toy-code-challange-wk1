##  Description

This document has three programms.

### 1. Student Grade Generator 

This is a programm that prompts the user to input student marks and outputs the students correct grades. The input is between 0 and 100.

### 2.Speed Detector 

It is a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
